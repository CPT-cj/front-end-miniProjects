# front-end-miniProjects
a bunch of frontend mini projects I built while grinding the frontend roadmap. Started with some HTML/CSS stuff, then jumped into JavaScript projects, and now mostly React.
Used Tailwind a lot, especially in React projects, trying to get clean UI without overthinking it.
Nothing fancy, just real practice, real mistakes, and real progress.❤️
